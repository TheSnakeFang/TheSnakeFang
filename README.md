Hello, I'm Kevin. You must be a recruiter, a PI, or someone with way too much time on their hands (I don't judge).

My old website repos are kept private (sorry), and all you'll find public here is my current website, some old school projects, and little things I've made through the years. I'm most proud of my CMU labs, but the risk of pesky academic integrity violations leading to expulsion keep me from sharing them. 

Contact me: kevinfang AT cmu.edu

Cheers!
