Hello, I'm Kevin. I am not a great coder so if you're here it's either by accident or I've decided to run for office/achieved some level of mediocrity, and you're snooping for dirt.
Either way, welcome! Out of pure shame, my old websites are kept private (sorry), and all you'll find here are some old school projects and little things I've made through the years.
If you want to contact me, you'll find me AT kevinfang.tech or kevinfang AT cmu.edu
Cheers!
