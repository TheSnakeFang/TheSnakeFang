Hello, my name is Kevin. I am not a great coder so if you're here it's either by accident or I've decided to run for office and you're snooping for dirt.
Either way, welcome! I think the only things I have public is my current website codebase (I'm too poor to pay to make it private) and a bunch of old school projects.
Feel free to look around! You can always email me if you have product management internship opportunities or just want to chat: kevinfang AT cmu.edu 
Cheers!
