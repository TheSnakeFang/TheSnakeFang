Hello, I'm Kevin. You must be a recruiter, a PI, or someone with way too much time on their hands (I don't judge).

Out of pure shame, my old website repos are kept private (sorry), and all you'll find public here is my website, some old school projects, and little things I've made through the years. I'm most proud of my CMU labs, but the risky of pesky academic integrity violations keep me from sharing them. 

My website is kevinfang.tech and email is kevinfang AT cmu.edu

Cheers!
