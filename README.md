Hello, I'm Kevin. You must be a recruiter, a PI, or someone with way too much time on their hands (I don't judge).

All you'll find public here is my current website, some old school projects, and little things I've made through the years. I'm most proud of my CMU labs, but the risk of pesky academic integrity violations leading to expulsion keep me from sharing them (sorry!).

Cheers!
